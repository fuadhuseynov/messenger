Basic REST API using JAX RS

It has 3 resources: Profile, Message and Comment 

For easy access I did not include a database in this code. All data is saved and initialized in Collections.

url for Message resource: http://localhost:8080/api/messages

url for Profile resource: http://localhost:8080/api/profiles

url for Comment resource: http://localhost:8080/api/messages/{messageId}/comments/{commentId}
